## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

During this project, I practiced using Flexbox to center and align elements and reinforced how to set up responsive layouts. I also learned how to use CSS custom properties for better color management.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to continue working on responsive design, focusing on using CSS Grid and Flexbox in combination for more complex layouts. Additionally, I want to explore more advanced CSS features like animations and transitions.
